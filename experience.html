    <h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Upon graduating from High School, I had my heart set on Fashion Design. I moved to Chicago where I attended the School of Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). After having my fingers pricked and breaking the sewing machine several times, my foundation courses helped me realize that Fashion Design was not the "glamorous" job that the young girl in me had once believed. I moved back home to Washington D.C to refocus my career path and switched to a more business route. Although I changed my focus completely, I still partook in several projects with friends that required any creative input. Today, I want to continue to learn anything in the creative field because being an 'artist' was my original <i>romantized dream</i> as a young girl. Currently living in Los Angeles, my interests include: <i>Photography, Graphic design, and Illustration.</i> Alongside my artistic hobbies, I am highly interested in international trade and business. My current work experiences include many of those aspects.</p>
