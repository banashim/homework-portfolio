    <h2>K-Town Drama Mama</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Ivana, but close friends call me <b>Bana</b> for short. I am born and raised in Northern Virginia, but I am currently living in Koreatown, Los Angeles. There is not much to say about me besides the fact that I love finding yummy places to eat, and I <i>absolutey ADORE dogs</i>. My lifelong dream is to live on a farm secluded from the city with a hundred dogs. <br><br>I guess one interesting fact about me is that I absolutely hate the smell/taste of cucumbers and watermelons because it smells/tastes repulsive to me similiar to how rotten fish would taste like. Apparently this is because I was born with an extra gene (<i>extra tastebud</i>) called <b>"TAS2R38"</b> (which not many people have.)<br><br> I love to travel and experience new things and can't seem to stay in one area for too long. The main reason why I also spontaneously moved to Los Angeles is because I wanted to leave the Virginia "bubble" and go beyond my comfort zone. While living in Los Angeles, I hope to expand my knowledge in both the creative and business field. I would love to learn web design and coding because it reminds me of my blogging days back in elementary school. Someday, I would love to use the knowlege I learn into starting a small, casual, online business. Although this is just the beginning, I hope that the web design courses that I take will be my small stepping stones to getting to my goals.
